v1.0.7 - 2017-02-08
=================

- Auto import foreign models


v1.0.4 - 2017-01-29
=================

- Allow use '0' or 0 as object's pk
- defaultPk attribute for ForeignKey provide default object for not
  assigned foreign object. This feature provide access to deep properties
  without risk of catch AttributeError. Eg: o = user.site.owner, where site
  and owner is ForeignKey to other model, but site is not set. In simple case
  we're catch AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'owner'. But,
  when site is ForeignKey(to='Site', defaultPk=0), then site always
  present as 'Site' model. At the moment, you need provide your 'Site'
  behavior with pk key is 0.
- Performance improvement: models using lazy initialization now
